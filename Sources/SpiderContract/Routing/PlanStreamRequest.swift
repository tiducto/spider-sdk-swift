/// POST body for `/routing/v1/plan-stream`: the Plan Trip search, streamed. Instead of a fixed window, the stream widens its search until it has sent at least `targetResults` itineraries or has searched `maxWindow`. To continue, send the `pageInfo` event's `endCursor` as `after` (later) or its `startCursor` as `before` (earlier); `before` and `after` are exclusive. A cursor carries the search it continues: it overrides `dateTime` (whether `earliestDeparture` or `latestArrival`) and the sort; `dateTime` stays required and is still checked. A key not listed here, at any depth, is a 400 `<path> is not allowed`, whatever its value, null included. Every bound is rejected, never clamped. `null` on an optional member means absent, and on a required member is a 400 `<path> is required`.
